# SPH (Smoothed Particles Hydrodynamics) 
- ## It is a computational method used for simulating the mechanics of continuum media, such as solid mechanics and fluid flows. Our focus in this simulation is the fluid flows.
- ## Our main purpose of this simulation is to calculate the displacement of the pipe, given some static data.
- ## It is splited into 4 parts:
  - ### IC : Initial Condition -> The initial static conditions.
  - ### DEFs: Definition of the functions -> The formulas and the equation.
  - ### Simulation: The main program.
  - ### Plot: In order to save the time of execution and take the already cached values saved on `.npy` format and plot it.
